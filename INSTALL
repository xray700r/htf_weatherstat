Installing the Software of the Weather Station is simple:

1. Download and install the Arduino IDE.

2. Download the code from the GitHub repo.

3. On the Arduino IDE:
Add the Zip libraries downloaded from:
https://github.com/rambo/TinyWire
https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BMP180_driver
https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library

BMP180_Breakout_Arduino_Library-master.zip
DHTLib.zip
TinyWireS.zip

4. Also all the files ending in *sensorsuery.cpp *sensorquery.h of the same sensor must be places in a folder with the same name and zipped. 
Include all the Zip libraries on the Arduino IDE.

Example:

AT85sensorquery.zip
BMP180sensorquery.zip
DHTsensorquery.zip
LMsensorquery.zip


5. On the Arduino UNO master compile and upload the sketch:
osws_master.ino 

In case all hardware has been set up correctly the output of the serial monitor on the Arduino IDE shall be similar to the following:

REBOOT
BMP180 init success

Weather Sensor Outputs:
Temperature[LM35]= 19.53 *C,
Temperature[DHT11]= 22.00 *C,
Temperature[BMP180]= 21.96 *C,
Humidity[DHT11]= 72.00 %RH,
Pessure[BMP180]absolute= 1002.53 mbar,
Pessure[BMP180]relative= 1014.86 mbar,
Luminance= 0 Lux,
