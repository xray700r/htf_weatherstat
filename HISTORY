January 2018 I start working on the OSWS as an implementation of a simple Weather Station project.


Version 1.0

February 2018 first vesrion is completed with one Arduino Uno I2C Master outputing the main data from the following sensors:

1. Thermometer: Temperature measurement
2. Hygrometer: Humidity measurement
3. Barometer: Atmospheric pressure measurement
4. Lux-meter: Measurement of light
